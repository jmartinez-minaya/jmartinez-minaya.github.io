Yet, little is known about the extent to which this incentive has generated a spatial relationship between green space and newly constructed housing at the city-wide level and in ways that can be compared between cities. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to precisely indicate the implications for housing rights, affordability, and broader goals of urban green justice. In response, this study explores quantitative trends in 26 mid-sized North American and European cities, utilizing greening and real estate data from the last three decades. Results show that greening becomes a more significant driver of development over time and operates to attract development in a growing number of cities, although more so in US cities.

To overcome these challenges, we propose the logistic-normal Dirichlet Model (LNDM). We seamlessly incorporate this approach into the R-INLA package, facilitating model fitting and model prediction within the framework of Latent Gaussian Models. Moreover, we explore metrics like Deviance Information Criteria, Watanabe Akaike information criterion, and cross-validation measure conditional predictive ordinate for model selection in R-INLA for CoDa. Illustrating LNDM through two simulated examples and with an ecological case study on Arabidopsis thaliana in the Iberian Peninsula, we underscore its potential as an effective tool for managing CoDa and large CoDa databases.","tags":["CoDa","Dirichlet","INLA","Spatial"],"title":"A flexible Bayesian tool for CoDa mixed models: logistic-normal distribution with Dirichlet covariance","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rThe project focuses on developing advanced predictive models to forecast sales for a jewelry company.

Bias in maturity ogive parameters can lead to fishery management decisions based on misspecified biological reference points. These parameters can vary spatially and temporally, and this variability should be understood and included in the assessment models. However, integrating this variability becomes challenging when specific spatial-dependent ogives cannot be used in the stock assessment model. Hence, this study proposes a novel use of a multivariate response Bayesian regression model, employing an integrated nested Laplace approximation to estimate a single global maturity ogive using data from various spatial areas. This model explicitly accounts for differences in the sampling process and combines information from different areas to estimate shared maturity ogive parameters using joint-likelihood procedures. The model is applied to the European hake stock in ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea) Divisions 27.8.c and 27.9.a, serving as a practical guide. In this model, we have considered different predictors to handle the relationship between the probability of being mature and the length and year covariates. Our results suggest that the logistic formulation correctly captures the relationship between the probability of being mature and length. For year variability, including a year factor covariate or year random effect in the predictor model produces similar values of goodness of fit measures.","tags":["Bayesian analysis","European hake","fish maturity","fishery management","unbalanced sampling"],"title":"A novel statistical approach to deal with spatial bias in maturity ogive estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando García-García","Dae-Jin Lee","Pedro Pablo España Yandiola","Isabel Urrutia Landa","Joaquín Martínez-Minaya","Miren Hayet-Otero","Mónica Nieves Ermecheo","José María Quintana","Rosario Menéndez","Antoni Torres","Rafael Zalacain Jorge","COVID-19 \u0026 Air Pollution Working Group"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704326400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704326400,"objectID":"29bb54892d872a5065a7ad10060c487a","permalink":"https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/en/publication/21.garcia-garcia_et_al_2024/","publishdate":"2024-01-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/21.garcia-garcia_et_al_2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: To study the suitability of cost-sensitive ordinal artificial intelligence-machine learning (AI-ML) strategies in the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severity. Materials \u0026 methods: Observational, retrospective, longitudinal, cohort study in 4 hospitals in Spain. Information regarding demographic and clinical status was supplemented by socioeconomic data and air pollution exposures. We proposed AI-ML algorithms for ordinal classification via ordinal decomposition and for cost-sensitive learning via resampling techniques. For performance-based model selection, we defined a custom score including per-class sensitivities and asymmetric misprognosis costs. 260 distinct AI-ML models were evaluated via 10 repetitions of 5×5 nested cross-validation with hyperparameter tuning. Model selection was followed by the calibration of predicted probabilities. Final overall performance was compared against five well-established clinical severity scores and against a ‘standard’ (non-cost sensitive, non-ordinal) AI-ML baseline. In our best model, we also evaluated its explainability with respect to each of the input variables. Results: The study enrolled n=1548 patients: 712 experienced low, 238 medium, and 598 high clinical severity. d=131 variables were collected, becoming d′=148 features after categorical encoding. Model selection resulted in our best-performing AI-ML pipeline having: a) no imputation of missing data, b) no feature selection (i.e. using the full set of d′ features), c) ‘Ordered Partitions’ ordinal decomposition, d) cost-based reimbalance, and e) a Histogram-based Gradient Boosting classifier. This best model (calibrated) obtained a median accuracy of 68.1% [67.3%, 68.8%] (95% confidence interval), a balanced accuracy of 57.0% [55.6%, 57.9%], and an overall area under the curve (AUC) 0.802 [0.795, 0.808].

Here we focused on a fully data-driven exploration regarding which factors (clinical or otherwise) were most informative for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia severity prediction via machine learning (ML). In particular, feature selection techniques (FS), designed to reduce the dimensionality of data, allowed us to characterize which of our variables were the most useful for ML prognosis. We conducted a multi-centre clinical study, enrolling n = 1548 patients hospitalized due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: where 792, 238, and 598 patients experienced low, medium and high-severity evolutions, respectively. Up to 106 patient-specific clinical variables were collected at admission, although 14 of them had to be discarded for containing ≥60% missing values. Alongside 7 socioeconomic attributes and 32 exposures to air pollution (chronic and acute), these became d = 148 features after variable encoding. We addressed this ordinal classification problem both as a ML classification and regression task. Two imputation techniques for missing data were explored, along with a total of 166 unique FS algorithm configurations: 46 filters, 100 wrappers and 20 embeddeds. Of these, 21 setups achieved satisfactory bootstrap stability (≥0.70) with reasonable computation times: 16 filters, 2 wrappers, and 3 embeddeds. The subsets of features selected by each technique showed modest Jaccard similarities across them. However, they consistently pointed out the importance of certain explanatory variables. Namely: patient’s C-reactive protein (CRP), pneumonia severity index (PSI), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen levels –saturation SpO2, quotients SpO2/RR and arterial SatO2/FiO2–, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) – to certain extent, also neutrophil and lymphocyte counts separately–, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and procalcitonin (PCT) levels in blood. A remarkable agreement has been found a posteriori between our strategy and independent clinical research works investigating risk factors for COVID-19 severity. Hence, these findings stress the suitability of this type of fully data-driven approaches for knowledge extraction, as a complementary to clinical perspectives.

The creation of marine protected areas plays an important role in the conservation of marine environment and its biodiversity. The distributions of top predators, as seabirds, have been commonly used for the management and creation of these figures of protection. The main objective of this study is to investigate seabirds biodiversity distribution in the Mediterranean Sea through the use of Bayesian spatial Beta regression models. We used an extensive historical database of at-sea locations of 19 different seabird species as well as geophysical, climatology variables and cumulative anthropogenic threats to model species biodiversity. We found negative associations between seabirds biodiversity and distance to the coast as well as concavity of the seabed, and positive with chlorophyll and slope. Further, a positive association was found between seabirds biodiversity and coastal impact. In this study we define as hot spot of seabird biodiversity those areas with a posterior predictive mean over 0.50. We found potential hot spots in the Mediterranean Sea which do not overlap with the existing MPASs and marine IBAs. Specifically, our hot spots areas do not overlap with the 52.04% and 16.87% of the current MPAs and marine IBAs, respectively. Overall, our study highlights the need for the extension of spatial prioritization of conservation areas to seabirds biodiversity, addressing the challenges of establishing transboundary governance.

However, to date the empirical evidence on the relationship between greenspaces and gentrification regarding associations with different greenspace types remains scarce. This study focused on 28 mid-sized cities in North America and Western Europe. We assessed improved access to different types of greenspace (i.e. total area of parks, gardens, nature preserves, recreational areas or greenways [i] added before the 2000s or [ii] added before the 2010s) and gentrification processes (including [i] gentrification for the 2000s; [ii] gentrification for the 2010s; [iii] gentrification throughout the decades of the 2000s and 2010s) in each small geographical unit of each city. To estimate the associations, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical spatial model for each city and gentrification time period (i.e. a maximum of three models per city). More than half of our models showed that parks—together with other factors such as proximity to the city center—are positively associated with gentrification processes, particularly in the US context, except in historically Black disinvested postindustrial cities with lots of vacant land. We also find than in half of our models newly designated nature preserves are negatively associated with gentrification processes, particularly when considering gentrification throughout the 2000s and the 2010s and in the US. Meanwhile, for new gardens, recreational spaces and greenways, our research shows mixed results (some positive, some negative and some no effect associations). Considering the environmental and health benefits of urban re-naturing projects, cities should keep investing in improving park access while simultaneously implementing anti-displacement and inclusive green policies.

In response to limited quantitative evidence documenting the temporal relationship between new greenspaces and gentrification across entire cities, let alone across various international contexts, we employ a spatially weighted Bayesian model to test the green gentrification hypothesis across 28 cities in 9 countries in North America and Europe. Here we show a strong positive and relevant relationship for at least one decade between greening in the 1990s–2000s and gentrification that occurred between 2000–2016 in 17 of the 28 cities. Our results also determine whether greening plays a “lead”, “integrated”, or “subsidiary” role in explaining gentrification.","tags":["green gentrification","urban greening","Bayesian model","spatial analysis","environmental justice"],"title":"Green gentrification in European and North American cities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lore Zumeta Olaskoaga","Dae-Jin Lee","Jon Larruskain","Eder Bikandi","Igor Setuain","Josean Lekue"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1654646400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654646400,"objectID":"0999cc1d3347bef0192312f47821110a","permalink":"https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/en/talk/modelling-and-prediction/","publishdate":"2022-09-15T12:43:45-08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/modelling-and-prediction/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modelling and prediction in time-to-event sports injury data: a penalized Cox regression approach","type":"event"},{"authors":["Lore Zumeta Olaskoaga","Xabier Monasterio","Jon Larruskain","Josean Lekue","Juan M.

Under Mediterranean conditions, P. nawae forms pseudothecia in the leaf litter in winter, and ascospores are released in spring, infecting susceptible leaves. Persimmon growers are advised to apply fungicides for CLS control during the period of inoculum availability, which was previously defined based on ascospore counts under the microscope. A model of inoculum availability of P. nawae was developed and evaluated as an alternative to ascospore counts. Leaf litter samples were collected weekly in L’Alcúdia (Spain) from 2010 to 2015. Leaves were soaked and placed in a wind tunnel, and the released ascospores of P. nawae were counted. Hierarchical Bayesian beta regression methods were used to model the dynamics of ascospore production in the leaf litter. The selected model included accumulated degree-days (ADDs) and ADDs taking into account the vapor pressure deficit (ADDvpd) as fixed effects and year as random effect. This model had a mean absolute error of 0.042 and a root mean square error of 0.062. The beta regression model was evaluated in four orchards from 2010 to 2015. Higher accuracy was obtained at the beginning and the end of the ascospore production period, which are the events of interest to schedule fungicide sprays for CLS control in Spain. This same modeling framework can be extended to other fungal plant pathogens whose inoculum dynamics are expressed as proportion data.","tags":["Decision Support System","Ecology and Epidemiology","Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)","Micology","Mycosphaerella nawae","Warning System"],"title":"Modeling Inoculum Availability of Plurivorosphaerella nawae in Persimmon Leaf Litter with Bayesian Beta Regression","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lore Zumeta Olaskoaga","Dae-Jin Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1630886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630886400,"objectID":"5b6eaede2b725c4ed3cfbf5d999e5f22","permalink":"https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/en/talk/flexible-time-to-event/","publishdate":"2022-09-15T12:43:45-08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/flexible-time-to-event/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Flexible time-to-event modelling approaches for recurrent football injury data","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\rIn this project, we utilize Bayesian Dirichlet models to analyze the impact of stress on vaginal microbiome composition.

We illustrate the performance of the coregionalized model in species interaction scenarios using both simulated and real data. The simulation demonstrates the better predictive performance of the coregionalized model with respect to the univariate models. The case study focus on the spatial distribution of a prey species, the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), and one of its predator species, the European hake (Merluccius merluccius), in the Mediterranean sea. The results indicate that European hake and anchovy are positively associated, resulting in improved model predictions using the coregionalized model.","tags":["Bayesian hierarchical models","coregionalized models","fisheries","INLA","predation","SPDE","species interaction"],"title":"Incorporating Biotic Information in Species Distribution Models: A Coregionalized Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joaquín Martínez-Minaya","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

In Alicante, Spain, almond leaf scorch, caused by X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex, was detected in 2017. The effects of climatic and spatial factors on the geographic distribution of X. fastidiosa in these two infested regions in Europe were studied. The presence/absence data of X. fastidiosa in the official surveys were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical models through the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) methodology. Climatic covariates were obtained from the WorldClim v.2 database. A categorical variable was also included according to Purcell’s minimum winter temperature thresholds for the risk of occurrence of Pierce’s disease of grapevine, caused by X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa. In Alicante, data were presented aggregated on a 1 km grid (lattice data), where the spatial effect was included in the model through a conditional autoregressive structure. In Lecce, data were observed at continuous locations occurring within a defined spatial domain (geostatistical data). Therefore, the spatial effect was included via the stochastic partial differential equation approach. In Alicante, the pathogen was detected in all four of Purcell’s categories, illustrating the environmental plasticity of the subsp. multiplex. Here, none of the climatic covariates were retained in the selected model. Only two of Purcell’s categories were represented in Lecce. The mean diurnal range (bio2) and the mean temperature of the wettest quarter (bio8) were retained in the selected model, with a negative relationship with the presence of the pathogen. However, this may be due to the heterogeneous sampling distribution having a confounding effect with the climatic covariates. In both regions, the spatial structure had a strong influence on the models, but not the climatic covariates. Therefore, pathogen distribution was largely defined by the spatial relationship between geographic locations. This substantial contribution of the spatial effect in the models might indicate that the current extent of X. fastidiosa in the study regions had arisen from a single focus or from several foci, which have been coalesced.","tags":["hierarchical Bayesian models","integrated nested Laplace approximation","stochastic partial differential equation","Xylella fastidiosa","species distribution models","olive quick decline","almond leaf scorch"],"title":"Spatial Bayesian Modeling Applied to the Surveys of Xylella fastidiosa in Alicante (Spain) and Apulia (Italy)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Neus Marimon","Iban Eduardo","Joaquín Martínez-Minaya","Antonio Vicent","Jordi Luque"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593993600,"objectID":"4e83866fdcf5a7724896b8eaff554ec3","permalink":"https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/en/publication/8.marimon_2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/8.marimon_2020/","section":"publication","summary":" The incidence of peach powdery mildew (PPM) on fruit was monitored in commercial peach orchards to i) describe the disease progress in relation to several environmental parameters and ii) establish an operating threshold to initiate a fungicide spray program based on accumulated degree-day (ADD) data.

To properly manage these potential threats we need a detailed understanding of the seasonal distributions of these highly mobile populations. To achieve this goal, a growing effort has been underway to develop species distribution models (SDMs) that correctly describe and predict preferred species areas. However, accuracy is not always easy to achieve when physical barriers, such as islands, are present. Indeed, SDMs assume, if only implicitly, that the spatial effect is stationary, and that correlation is only dependent on the distance between observations and not on the direction or a spatial coordinates. The application of stationary SDMs in these cases could lead to incorrect predictions and, consequently, to uninformed decision making. In this study, we identify vulnerable habitats for the bottlenose dolphin in the Archipelago de La Maddalena, Northern Sardinia (Italy) using Bayesian hierarchical SDMs that account for the physical barriers issue and provide a full specification of the associated uncertainty. The approach we propose constitutes a major step forward in the understanding of cetacean species in many ecosystems where physical, geographical and topographical barriers are present.

Multiple efforts are currently focused on the development of models to better predict distribution range shifts due to GCC. We addressed this issue by including intraspecific genetic structure and spatial autocorrelation (SAC) of data in distribution range models. Both factors reflect the joint effect of ecoevolutionary processes on the geographical heterogeneity of populations. We used a collection of 301 georeferenced accessions of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana in its Iberian Peninsula range, where the species shows strong geographical genetic structure. We developed spatial and nonspatial hierarchical Bayesian models (HBMs) to depict current and future distribution ranges for the four genetic clusters detected. We also compared the performance of HBMs with Maxent (a presence-only model). Maxent and nonspatial HBMs presented some shortcomings, such as the loss of accessions with high genetic admixture in the case of Maxent and the presence of residual SAC for both. As spatial HBMs removed residual SAC, these models showed higher accuracy than nonspatial HBMs and handled the spatial effect on model outcomes. The ease of modelling and the consistency among model outputs for each genetic cluster was conditioned by the sparseness of the populations across the distribution range. Our HBMs enrich the toolbox of software available to evaluate GCC-induced distribution range shifts by considering both genetic heterogeneity and SAC, two inherent properties of any organism that should not be overlooked.","tags":["Arabidopsis thaliana","geographical genetic structure","global climate change","hierarchical Bayesian models","Maxent","spatial autocorrelation"],"title":"A hierarchical Bayesian Beta regression approach to study the effects of geographical genetic structure and spatial autocorrelation on species distribution range shifts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lore Zumeta Olaskoaga","Jon Larruskain","Josean Lekue","Eder Bikandi","Igor Setuain","Ekhine Irurozki","Dae-Jin Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1548288000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548288000,"objectID":"52588ec0140915e9409131a385285f68","permalink":"https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/en/talk/survival-analysis-in-professional-sports-injuries/","publishdate":"2022-09-15T12:43:45-08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/survival-analysis-in-professional-sports-injuries/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Survival analysis in professional sports injuries with multivariate regression trees","type":"event"},{"authors":["Lore Zumeta Olaskoaga","Felix Zubia Olaskoaga","Guadalupe Gómez Melis"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531008000,"objectID":"8cc5e6b2d06a2188d62474be6d0e29f3","permalink":"https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/en/talk/a-multi-state-model/","publishdate":"2022-09-15T12:43:45-08:00","relpermalink":"/en/talk/a-multi-state-model/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A multi-state model for the prognosis of non-mild acute pancreatitis","type":"event"},{"authors":["Joaquín Martínez-Minaya","Michela Cameletti","David Conesa","Maria Grazia Pennino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524096000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524096000,"objectID":"aa1097afc497841f8afbf395b5f13f45","permalink":"https://jmartinez-minaya.github.io/en/publication/3.martinez-minaya_2018a/","publishdate":"2018-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/publication/3.martinez-minaya_2018a/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of complex statistical models has recently increased substantially in the context of species distribution behavior.

The role of climate as a limiting factor for the establishment and spread of CBS to new areas has been debated, but previous studies did not address the effects of spatial factors in the geographic distribution of the disease. The effects of climatic and spatial factors were studied using South Africa as a case study, due to its diversity of climates within citrus-growing regions. Georeferenced datasets of CBS presence/absence in citrus areas were assembled for two stages of the epidemic: 1950 and 2014. Climatic variables were obtained from the WorldClim database. Moran’s I and Geary’s C analyses indicated that CBS distribution data presented significant spatial autocorrelation, particularly in 2014. Collinearity was detected among climatic variables. Spatial logistic regressions, particular case of latent Gaussian models, were fitted to CBS presence/absence in 1950 or 2014 with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation methodology. Principal components (PCs) or pre-selection of climatic variables based on their correlation coefficients were used to cope with collinearity. Spatial effects were incorporated with a geostatistical term. In general, the models indicated a positive relationship between CBS presence and climatic variables or PCs associated with warm temperatures and high precipitation. Nevertheless, in 1950, models that also included a spatial effect outperformed those with climatic variables only. Problems of model convergence were detected in 2014 due to the strong spatial structure of CBS distribution data. The consequences of ignoring spatial dependence to estimate the potential geographical range of CBS are discussed.

(European Journal of Plant Pathology 143, 69–83, 2015) performed an analysis of climate-based distribution of citrus black spot (CBS) in South Africa. It was found that CBS was initially confined to humid areas with summer rainfall, but later spread to arid steppe and even desert climates. A strong spatial autocorrelation of CBS distribution was found. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) take a critical view of our study, but without presenting any analysis of results to refute our findings. Furthermore, Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) appear to have misunderstood our work, since many of their criticisms relate to the potential distribution of CBS in Europe, which is beyond the scope of our original study. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) highlight the limitations of climate classifications in species distribution modelling. However, this was made explicit in our study, indicating that it was a preparatory work and further advanced modelling studies, including spatial effects, will be needed. Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) incorrectly assume that we used all of South Africa as the background in the spatial autocorrelation analysis. However, only citrus areas were used and a strong spatial autocorrelation was detected at all distances evaluated. Contrary to what Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) suggest, similar climate distributions of CBS were obtained at 5′ and 30′ resolution, and also with the national land-cover map of South Africa. The figure comparison presented by Fourie et al. (European Journal of Plant Pathology, 2017) appears to ignore the fact that the maps we used were grid cells of 10 × 10 km and not the line polygons they suggest. Therefore, we consider the conclusions from the Martínez-Minaya et al.

The Mediterranean Basin is free of the disease and thus phytosanitary measures are in place to avoid the entry of P. citricarpa in the EU territory. However, the suitability of the climates present in the Mediterranean Basin for CBS establishment and spread is debated. As a case study, an analysis of climate types and environmental variables in South Africa was conducted to identify potential associations with CBS distribution. The spread of the disease was traced and georeferenced datasets of CBS distribution and environmental variables were assembled. In 1950 CBS was still confined to areas of temperate climates with summer rainfall (Cw, Cf), but spread afterwards to neighbouring regions with markedly drier conditions. Actually, the hot arid steppe (BSh) is the predominant climate where CBS develops in South Africa nowadays. The disease was not detected in the Mediterranean-type climates Csa and Csb as defined by the Köppen-Geiger system and the more restrictive Aschmann’s classification criteria. However, arid steppe (BS) climates, where CBS is prevalent in South Africa, are common in important citrus areas in the Mediterranean Basin. The most noticeable change in the environmental range occupied by CBS in South Africa was the amount and seasonality of rainfall. Due to the spread of the disease to dryer regions, the minimum annual precipitation in CBS-affected areas declined from 663 mm in 1950 to 339 mm at present. The minimum value precipitation of warmest quarter also declined from 290 to 96 mm. Strong spatial autocorrelation in CBS distribution data was detected, so further modelling efforts should consider the relative contribution of environmental variables and spatial effects to estimate the potential geographical range of CBS.
