# Personal Website of JoaquÃ­n MartÃ­nez Minaya

This is the source code for my personal academic website.

The site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and a customized theme. It includes information about my research projects, teaching, publications, and academic collaborations.

ðŸ§­ The website is inspired by the clean and elegant design of [Lore Zumeta Olaskoaga's personal site](https://lzumeta.eus/en/), whose structure and aesthetics served as a reference during the development process.

## ðŸš€ Deployment

The website is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and is automatically updated on each push to the main branch.
