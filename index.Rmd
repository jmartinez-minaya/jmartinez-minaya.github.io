### Brief description

<div align="justify">
Welcome to this place! ;)

I am **Joaquín Martínez-Minaya**, currently working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Applied Statistics and Operations Research and Quality at Polytechnic University of Valencia. My primary interest lies in **Applied Bayesian Statistics**, where I am actively engaged in advancing the field of **Species Distribution Modeling** through the application of **Spatio-Temporal Statistics**. This involves a comprehensive exploration of the dynamic behaviors exhibited by plant and marine species, utilizing sophisticated modeling techniques to enhance our understanding of their spatial and temporal patterns.

Currently, **health and environment** stand as fundamental pillars of my research, and I am currently involved in innovative projects such as **studying microbiota** using multivariate hierarchical Bayesian models, assessing **measurement agreement** through Bayesian mixed models, conducting **medical image analysis** with Bayesian spatio-temporal models, and applying spatial statistics to the field of **Spatial Transcriptomics**.

Moreover, my expertise extends to **Bayesian computational methods**, where I specialize in implementing techniques within the framework of the **Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA)** and **Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods (MCMC)**. This computational aspect forms an integral part of my holistic approach to addressing diverse challenges within the health and environmental sectors.
